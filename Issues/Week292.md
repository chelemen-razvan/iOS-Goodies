Happy Thursday! I've looked a bit into Dark Mode for iOS 13 this week. While I initially loved the idea of dark mode, I have a few mixed feelings about it. Sure, when you watch the [WWDC sessions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/214/) [about it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/808/) the switch seems very easy and natural. But when you take a real app, one that you built for a client, for example, it's not that easy anymore. You need to change the colors without affecting the product's brand in any way and still keeping the same "feeling" of the app. That's a job for a designer. If you haven't talked to the designers you work with about Dark Mode, now it's a good time to do it. Out of the box, depending on how they've defined the colors, older apps built with iOS 13 SDK can look quite weird in dark mode, with some colors being switched to dark automatically, and others staying the same. Good news is that it seems apps built with iOS 12 SDK and older will still look the same on iOS 13 with Dark Mode enabled (except the UIAlertControllers, which will be dark). And until you're ready to fully adopt Dark Mode, you can "opt-out" by setting a key in `Info.plist`. But I'm quite sure there will be some pressure from the users, and also from Apple, for all apps to adopt Dark Mode sooner or later.
